        <h3 class="font-weight-light">Hello, You‚Äôre my <span class="font-weight-bold">Muse</span></h3>
        <p>Dumbooo, you're the radiant starlight that graces my mundane life, you're like the gentle whisper of the wind that caresses my soul, and the melody that tunes in my heart. Your caring soul, a mosiac of kindness and respect for me, has become the cornerstone upon which the foundation of our relationship stands and in future also I'll completely relay on you.<br><br> 
          My life is like a finely woven fabric with various threads and patterns, each representing different experiences, people, and events, but you are the vibrant thread that adds color to my world, Love!. Your love for me is hard to put in words but I'll try, "A painting crafted with strokes of understanding, patience, and unwavering support". You nurture me like a delicate flower, tending to it with the utmost care, and in your eyes, I find the reflection of my truest self. Your presence is my haven where I find calm and peace.
        <br><br>
        You are not just a writer or a poet, a magician who conjures emotions with mere words. Your verses, like cascading waterfalls, flow with an elegance that captures the essence of love. When you pen down your thoughts, it's as if the universe conspires to create a moment of divine connection. Your love notes, adorned with the beauty of your soul, are treasures I hold close to my heart. You words written upon the pages resonates with the depth of your feelings, you forming a bridge that spans the distance between our hearts though we are far from eachother .
        <br><br>
        You are my rivital ki tablet, to inspire me to reach greater heights, to boost me when I'm down, and to love with a passion that knows no bounds. Your presence is a constant reminder of the beauty that resides in the world.
          <br><br>
          With each passing day, my admiration for you grows, like a sturdy oak tree that withstands the test of time. Your strength, both emotional and spiritual, gives me a guidance in our tough time. And dumbo in you I find a universe of endless possibilities even that which seems impossible to me for a time because you've the tawakkul in Allah and because of that I start feeling that yes anything is possible you Allah is with you.
          <br><br>
          I am profoundly grateful to have you by my side, to share this journey of life, love, and honestly I wanna add one more thing which I feel i.e. self-discovery. You are not just amazing; you are extraordinary in every sense of the word for me. I cherish you, not only for the love you give but for the person you are‚Äîthe beautiful, funny, moody, loving, and caring soul who has captured my heart and soul.
          <br><br>
          In you, earlier I had found only a friend in you like couple of months before going to Lko but now I feel I have found a confidant, a life partner, and a worship partner. Together Inshallah we'll create a story of us that will be told and retold for generations to come and guess by who? Obviously You!. You are my greatest blessing, my sweetest serendipity, and my eternal muse. Btw I love to call you my muse üëâüèΩüëàüèΩ
          <br><br>
          And I want to take an OATH today, "I'm standing here not honestly I'm sitting and writing khair moving on, enveloped in the warmth of your love, I am filled with awe and gratitude. I promise to cherish you (Inshaallah), to honor you (Inshaallah), and to love you with every fiber of my being (Inshaallah)''. You are not just the love of my life; you are my life‚Äôs greatest love story. And for that, I am eternally thankful.
